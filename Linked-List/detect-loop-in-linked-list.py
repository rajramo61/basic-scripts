'''
Detecting Loops in Linked ListsÂ¶
In this notebook, you'll implement a function that detects if a loop exists in a linked list. 
The way we'll do this is by having two pointers, called "runners", moving through the list at different 
rates. Typically we have a "slow" runner which moves at one node per step and a "fast" runner that moves
 at two nodes per step.

If a loop exists in the list, the fast runner will eventually move behind the slow runner as it moves to 
the beginning of the loop. Eventually it will catch up to the slow runner and both runners will be 
pointing to the same node at the same time. If this happens then you know there is a loop in the linked 
list.
